# uni-research-papers

A non-exhaustive list of "research" papers I've done during my studies:

1.  [Ethics of IT Organizations - Contingent Workers, Outsourcing](https://github.com/KushtrimPacaj/uni-research-papers/blob/main/Ethics%20of%20IT%20Organizations%20-%20Contingent%20Workers%2C%20Outsourcing.pdf) is a paper made for **_IT Ethics_** class

2.  [Heartbeat signal with ARDUINO and MATLAB](https://github.com/KushtrimPacaj/uni-research-papers/blob/main/Elektronika%20digjitale%20dhe%20sinjalet%20-%20Heartbeat%20signal%20with%20ARDUINO%20and%20MATLAB%20.pdf) is a paper made for **_Digital Electronics & Signals_** class. This paper is in Albanian due to requirement from the professor. If you're a non-native speaker, you'll maybe at least understand the code snippets.

3.  [Advanced Operating Systems - SPECTRE attack and mitigations](https://github.com/KushtrimPacaj/uni-research-papers/blob/main/Advanced%20Operating%20Systems%20-%20SPECTRE%20attack%20and%20mitigations.pdf) - We could chose any subject regarding operating systems to make a paper on, and I was fascinated (and horrified) by the Meltdown & Spectre attacks and decided to do a deep dive into their cause and possible mitigations done.
  
4.  [Peer to Peer Audio and Video Communication using WebRTC](https://github.com/KushtrimPacaj/uni-research-papers/blob/main/Peer%20to%20Peer%20Audio%20and%20Video%20Communication%20using%20WebRTC.pdf) is a paper initally made for **_Advanced programming_** class, but later extended and published/presented at 2020 UBT International Conference. Preprint also available at [EasyChair](https://easychair.org/publications/preprint/PMZj) and conference infos can be found [here](https://knowledgecenter.ubt-uni.net/conference/2020/all_events/320/).  You can find the code [here](https://github.com/KushtrimPacaj/AP.Project.WebRTC.Mobile) and [here](https://github.com/KushtrimPacaj/AP.Project.WebRTC.Signaling)

5. [Dependency injection](https://github.com/KushtrimPacaj/uni-research-papers/blob/main/Dependency%20Injection%20-%20Bachelor%20thesis.pdf) is my thesis for the _"Bachelor of Mathematics - Computer Sciences"_ degree from the [_Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences_](https://fshmn.uni-pr.edu/) of _University of Prishtina_ . The thesis is in Albanian and not English due to university requirements. You can find the library made as part of it in the following repo: [KushtrimPacaj/GallifreyDI](https://github.com/KushtrimPacaj/gallifreydi)

6. [Cambridge Analytica - Ethics and voter manipulation](https://github.com/KushtrimPacaj/uni-research-papers/blob/main/Cambridge%20Analytica%20-%20Ethics%20and%20voter%20manipulation.pdf) is a paper analyzing the Cambridge Analytica scandal.
